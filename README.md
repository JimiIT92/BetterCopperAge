Make Copper Golems interact with Copper Buttons, like originally intended, and boost your builds with new decorative blocks!

-------------------------

### ü§ñ Features

### COPPER BUTTONS

Originally, Copper Golem was designed to interact with Copper Buttons.

Unfortunately, these have not been added with the Fall Drop.... until now!

Craft them using any Copper Block in a Stonecutter and use them in your builds.

They are also a unique redstone component, because they'll stay pressed the longer they're oxidized. 

When non-oxidized, they'll act like Stone buttons and stay pressed for 20 ticks, with each oxidation level increasing
the duration by 10 ticks.

If they are pressed while oxidizing, waxing or scraping, their press state will be reset.

### MEDIUM WEIGHTED PRESSURE PLATES

Crafted with 2 copper ingots, these new Weighted Pressure Plates acts as a middle ground between the Light and the
Heavy Weighted ones.

They oxidize over time and can be waxed, like any other Copper Block, and behave exactly like a Weighted Pressure Plate
would do (except that you'll need fewer items to reach power level 15).

#### CRAFTABLE COPPER GOLEM STATUES

Can't wait to have your Copper Golem statue? No problem! You can now craft them using a carved pumpkin and a Copper Block.
