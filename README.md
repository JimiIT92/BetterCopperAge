Make Copper Golems interact with Copper Buttons, like originally intended, and boost your builds with new decorative blocks!

-------------------------

### ü§ñ Features

### COPPER FIRE AND CAMPFIRE

What happens if you mix Copper and Fire? You get Copper Fire!

This new Green Flame can be obtained if a Copper Block is set on fire.

<img src="./.docs/copper_fire.png" alt="Copper Fire" />

Emits a light level of 13 and deals 1.5x fire damage

And, since there is Copper Fire, there's now also the Copper Campfire!

<img src="./.docs/copper_campfire.png" alt="Copper Campfire" />

Crafted like a Soul Campfire, but using any Block that can produce Copper Fire in the middle.

Deals the same amount of damage as regular Campfire and drops a Copper Nugget if broken without Silk Touch.
Can be waterlogged

### COPPER HORN AND NEW GOAT HORN SOUNDS

Copper Horn was a scrapped feature from the Caves & Cliffs update, but now is back!

Crafted by surrounding a Goat Horn with 3 Copper Ingots, will return a different Copper Horn based on the Goat Horn used.

They'll produce a different sound based on how they are played:
- A high-pitched sound if the player is looking straight up
- A bass sound if the player is sneaking
- The regular sound otherwise

<img src="./.docs/copper_horn.png" alt="Copper Horn" />

Also, two scrapped Goat Horn sounds has been added, that can also be turned into Copper Horns.

- Fly: dropped from regular Goats
- Resist: dropped from screaming Goats

### COPPER BUTTONS

Originally, Copper Golem was designed to interact with Copper Buttons.

Unfortunately, these have not been added with the Fall Drop.... until now!

<img src="./.docs/copper_buttons.png" alt="Copper Buttons" />

Craft them using any Copper Block in a Stonecutter and use them in your builds.

<img src="./.docs/copper_button_crafting.png" alt="Copper Button Crafting" />

They are also a unique redstone component, because they'll stay pressed the longer they're oxidized. 

When non-oxidized, they'll act like Stone buttons and stay pressed for 20 ticks, with each oxidation level increasing
the duration by 10 ticks.

If they are pressed while oxidizing, waxing or scraping, their press state will be reset.

Plus, if a Copper Golem stops on them, there's a chance that they'll press the button!

### MEDIUM WEIGHTED PRESSURE PLATES

Crafted with 2 copper ingots, these new Weighted Pressure Plates acts as a middle ground between the Light and the
Heavy Weighted ones.

<img src="./.docs/medium_weighted_pressure_plate_crafting.png" alt="Medium Weighted Pressure Plate Crafting" />

They oxidize over time and can be waxed, like any other Copper Block, and behave exactly like a Weighted Pressure Plate
would do (except that you'll need fewer items to reach power level 15).

<img src="./.docs/medium_weighted_pressure_plates.png" alt="Medium Weighted Pressure Plates" />

Like copper buttons, these will stay pressed longer based on their oxidation level (starting at 20 ticks, 
like regular pressure plates, going up to 50).

Also like copper buttons, if they are pressed while oxidizing, waxing or scraping, their power level will be reset.

### WRENCH

Using 2 Iron Ingots and 2 Copper Ingots you can craft a new tool: the Wrench!

<img src="./.docs/wrench_crafting.png" alt="Wrench Crafting" />

With the wrench you can now rotate any Block that can be rotated without the need to break and place them again.

Left-click the Block with the Wrench to cycle the different orientations (if you are also sneaking, property will be cycled in the reversed order)

<img src="./.docs/wrench.gif" alt="Player using a Wrench" />

It has 512 uses

### IRON AND GOLD DECORATIVE BLOCKS

This new drop adds a ton of decorative blocks for Copper. So, why not give Iron and Gold the same treatment?

### BETTER SHELVES

The Shelf is a great Block for building and decorations, and it has two modes of displaying Items. 
But only one is accessible in Vanilla Minecraft, which is a shame to be honest...

That's why, if you now Shift-Right Click a shelf with an empty hand, it will toggle its display mode!

<img src="./.docs/shelf_display_mode_toggle.gif" alt="Shelf Display Mode Toggled" />

### BETTER COPPER GOLEMS

Can't wait to have your Copper Golem statue? No problem! You can now craft them using a carved pumpkin and a Copper Block.

<img src="./.docs/craftable_copper_golem_statue.png" alt="Craftable Copper Golem Statue" />

They'll also now deposit Items in Barrels and Shulker Boxes as well

<img src="./.docs/copper_golem_opening_shulker_box.png" alt="Copper Golem opening a Shulker Box" />

The list of containers that the Copper Golem can deposit Items to is controlled by a new Block tag, 
`betterfalldrop:copper_golem_output_containers`. You can find the list of supported containers [here](https://github.com/JimiIT92/BetterFallDrop/blob/master/src/main/resources/data/betterfalldrop/tags/block/copper_golem_output_containers.json)

Iron Golems will sometimes place a Poppy on top of a Copper Golem.

But what if you don't want to wait for this event? Or, even better, you want to put
other type of items on it?

Well, now you can! You can now put a broader variety of Items and Blocks on top of a Copper Golem
by simply right-click.

<img src="./.docs/copper_golem_wearing_heavy_core.png" alt="Copper Golem wearing Heavy Core" />

The list is controlled by the `minecraft:shearable_from_copper_golem` tag, which has been expanded
to include all the Blocks and Items that you can now put on a Copper Golem.

This also means that, using a pair of Shears, you can take the Item back from the Copper Golem.

You can find the full list [here](https://github.com/JimiIT92/BetterFallDrop/blob/master/src/main/resources/data/minecraft/tags/item/shearable_from_copper_golem.json)

### COPPER ATTRACTS LIGHTNINGS

If there's a storm, you better not going out with some Copper Armor or let your Copper Golem outside, because
now a Lightning can strike any Player/Horse wearing some Copper Armor or any Copper Golem, if there are no
Lightning Rods nearby.
